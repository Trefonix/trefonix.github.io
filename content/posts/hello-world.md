Having been in the back of my mind for at least 3 years, it's good to finally have my own space for publishing my technical pieces on the internet. 

I'm not anticipating posting regularly - I expect I will only post when I have something to share as opposed to working to any schedule.

Anyway, I suppose I ought to get to writing the first real blog post. Feedback is always appreciated and I would suggest tweeting me at [@AlexMcCoy41](https://twitter.com/AlexMcCoy41).
