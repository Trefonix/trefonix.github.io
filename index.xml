      <description>Preamble I often get asked &amp;lsquo;what books do you recommend for [insert topic here]&amp;rsquo;, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write down in one place the books that I&amp;rsquo;ve so-far read and think are of value. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this page updated with whatever books I think deserve adding.
Fair warning, I&amp;rsquo;ve become a bit of a No Starch Press fanboy.
The Books Title: Real World Bug Hunting
ISBN-13: 978-1-59327-861-8

      <description>Introduction Famously, Microsoft loves to make out that they love developers (developers, developers, developers). Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s this love of developers that spurred them to implement a generous range of features into their SharePoint RESI API, with the intention of enabling custom web-apps to extend default functionality.
One day, I was looking through the documentation for the PnP SharePoint Library (as you do), and I noticed a feature labelled &amp;lsquo;sendEmail&amp;rsquo;. On closer inspection, this feature allows you to send an email to anybody inside your Microsoft 365 tenancy with an arbitrary sender &amp;lsquo;name&amp;rsquo; (the actual sending address is no-reply@sharepointonline.</description>

      <description>Having been in the back of my mind for at least 3 years, it&amp;rsquo;s good to finally have my own space for publishing my technical pieces on the internet.
I&amp;rsquo;m not anticipating posting regularly - I expect I will only post when I have something to share as opposed to working to any schedule.
Anyway, I suppose I ought to get to writing the first real blog post. Feedback is always appreciated and I would suggest tweeting me at @AlexMcCoy41.</description>
